### Future Development

* The National Park API offers a multitude of options to pull from things to do, weather, and tours. A first expansion would be to select a specfic park and pull whatever information the user could desire from that API.

* A snag in our development came in using Local Storage. Currently the app will store the most recent pull from a search as an object into storage but does not do anything with said object. A button/page to pull up past search results would be a nice addition as well.
