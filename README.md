## Title: 

National Parks and Bikes R Us

## Description: 

Mountain Hiker Fiends is an app that offers a user local hiking trails and the weather forecast for each trail. We also include mountain bike options for the user in the event they are interested in biking and hiking.

### User Stories:

As an extreme sport enthusiast I want to find a local National Park and the current weather forecast so that I can ensure I am challenged and safe synchronically.
I also want to find an appropriate mountain bike on the page in case I’d like to take my extreme sport enthusiasm to the next level.

My enthusiasm is burgeoning for extreme sports and I’d like to find an easy trail to hike so that the flame of my passion is stoked rather than extinguished.
Additionally, I enjoy camping! Where can I find fun and clean camp sites in my local National Parks?
